# Scanning-Helium-Microscope-Diffraction-Measuement-Simulation

Created by **Ke Wang** with help from **Boyao Liu** and **Min Lin**.

It is an interactive script that simulates the diffraction measurement of the SHeM. It allows different surface lattice structures and different pinhole plate geometry to be simulated. The input of the Multiscat is also implemented, which makes it a good script to visualize the multiscat result.

![Simulation Parameters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6457edca-29f1-46cb-b8f2-24b7fd06dd95)

**Diffraction channel**: Number of diffraction channels in the script. (10 means the diffraction channels from [-10,-10] [-10,-9]... to ...[9,10] [10,10] will be examined)

**Lattice constant**: The real space lattice separation.

**Lattice vector**: Lattice vector of the unit cell.

**Beam Energy**: The simulation assumes the Helium beam is monochromatic.

**In-plane & Out-plane axis**: The full length of two axes of the elliptical detector aperture.

**Pinhole-Detector Separation**: The vertical distance between the center of the pinhole aperture and detector aperture.

**Sample z position**: The location of the sample
